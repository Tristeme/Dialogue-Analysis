Speaker A: Hey, did you, um, end up going to that concert last night?
Speaker B: Yeah, I did! It was, like, super loud but really fun.
Speaker A: I kinda wish I had gone, you know? Everyone was talking about it.
Speaker B: You should’ve! I mean, the band was amazing live.
Speaker A: Who opened for them? I didn’t even check the lineup.
Speaker B: Some indie group—actually, I forgot their name, but they were decent.
Speaker A: Haha, fair enough. Sometimes the openers are just... there.
Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Oh, and I ran into Mark and Jess!
Speaker A: No way! Like, I haven’t seen them in forever.
Speaker B: I know, right? We grabbed a quick bite after the show.
Speaker A: Nice. So, um, are you free this weekend for a movie night?
Speaker B: I think so. Depends on work, but I’ll try to keep it open.
Speaker A: I’ve been dying to watch that new thriller everyone’s raving about.
Speaker B: Same! The trailer gave me chills—looks intense.
Speaker A: Cool. Let’s plan for Saturday then, if that works?
Speaker B: Sounds good. I’ll text you the details later!
